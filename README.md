# Yet Another Roguelike

My now 5th attempt at making a game. Giving Python a go this time. C++ can go to hell!

## Can I play this thing?

You can try.

For now, you will need to run the system in debug mode

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py --debug --no-core --load core_pak/manifest.json debug_pak/manifest.json
```
