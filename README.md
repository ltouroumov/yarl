# Yet Another Roguelike

My now 5th attempt at making a game. Giving Python a go this time. C++ can go to hell!

## Can I play this thing?

You can try. You will need:

* Python Runtime 3.3
* pySFML (1.3)
* cython (0.19)
* numpy

And lots of patience!

## Where is the license for the art?

I lost it. If you can find the tileset on [OpenGameArt](opengameart.org), send me a mesage!
